            <img src="./images/adeboye1.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                In an experience that could be described as his wake up call, his daughter became ill in 1973, and proved unresponsive to several bouts of orthodox medicine.<br><br>
                A cousin had invited him and his wife to a parish of RCCG to seek divine healing for their daughter.<br><br>
                On July 29, 1973, Enoch Adeboye made a personal commitment to Christ through the ministry of Reverend Josiah Olufemi Akindayomi, the founder and first general overseer of The Redeemed Christian Church of God.<br><br>
                Reverend Akindayomi was uneducated but was supernaturally endowed with the ability to read the Holy Bible in his native language.<br><br>
                He was ordained as a Pastor in RCCG in 1977, Pastor Adeboye received a solid foundation in the scriptures.<br><br>

                These were very successfully conducted in various cities all over South-West Nigeria.<br><br>
                In 1981, when the founder passed to glory, the baton of leadership was handed over to him by divine orchestration.<br><br>
                He conducts his ministry through the RCCG, including: <br><br>
